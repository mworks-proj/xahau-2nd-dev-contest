## Project Title
xMerch Launch Pad (PoC): Token Factory & Market Maker (MM v1) on Xahau

## Brief Description
xMerch Launch Pad is a proof of concept focused on safe IOU token issuance and initial market bootstrap on the Xahau ledger. It enables builders to create IOU assets and form early on-ledger markets, with a lightweight DEX interface used only for discovery and swaps. The Market Maker (MM v1) is deterministic and admin-controlled for bootstrap purposes.
