## 📌 Participation Rules

* You can submit **as many projects as you like**.
* Each project may be submitted by an individual or a group of participants.
* Different projects from the same participant(s) can be eligible for different prizes.
* Projects **must run on the Xahau Mainnet**.
* Each project **must be accessible online**, so that both judges and the public can use or view it.

  * This avoids the need for judges to install or configure projects locally, and reduces the risk of unexpected errors or participant assistance being required.
* Each submission must include **basic documentation** to help others understand the project.

  * Optionally, you can also include **multimedia material** (videos, slides, demos, etc.) to better explain your work.
* **AI tools** may be used both for development and documentation.
* If your project uses **Hooks**, the Hook code must be open source, so that it can be audited for safety and serve as a learning resource for the community. You must attach their C code in your submission along with the hook hash. Check the “Submission Format” section.
* Projects that clearly offer regulated financial services or that target illegal activities are not eligible.
* To be evaluated by the judges, you must include your submission with a PR as indicated in the “Submission Format” section.
* Once your submission PR has been created, post a tweet on X about your project, tagging @XahauNetwork, to announce that you’ve participated in the Xahau Dev Contest.
